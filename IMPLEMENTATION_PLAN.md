# Daft Gila Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation plan to transform Daft Gila from a comprehensive authentication demo into a minimal viable authentication platform and OIDC provider. The goal is to maintain all existing functionality while streamlining the codebase and adding OIDC capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Authentication**: JWT, OAuth, and GSSAPI/Kerberos already implemented
- **Well-Structured Code**: Clean separation of concerns with blueprint-based architecture
- **Database Design**: Solid models for users, OAuth providers, and GSSAPI realms
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose setup with proper service dependencies
- **Security**: Proper password hashing, token blacklisting, and encryption

### Recent Accomplishments ✅
- **Phase 1 Complete**: All code cleanup, database optimization, and API standardization completed
- **Frontend Refactored**: Organized into logical blueprints with shared utilities
- **Auth Package**: Modular authentication system with separate modules for core, OAuth, and GSSAPI
- **Template Updates**: All frontend templates updated to work with new blueprint structure
- **Admin Config Fixed**: Resolved API mismatch between backend and frontend for configuration display

### Areas for Improvement
- **Code Complexity**: Some endpoints have redundant admin checks
- **OIDC Support**: Missing OpenID Connect provider functionality
- **Cross-Domain Sessions**: No domain-level session cookie support
- **Configuration**: Some hardcoded values that could be runtime configurable
- **Documentation**: API documentation could be more comprehensive

## Conclusion

This phased approach ensures that Daft Gila evolves into a production-ready, minimal viable authentication platform while maintaining all existing functionality. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for iterative development and testing.

**Phase 1 has been completed successfully**, providing a solid foundation for the OIDC implementation in Phase 2. The codebase is now clean, maintainable, and ready for the next phase of development.

The focus on minimalism and reusability will make Daft Gila an excellent choice for organizations needing a lightweight but powerful authentication solution that can grow with their needs.
